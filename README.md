# DAO.sol

My contracts are crafted in Yul (Solidity Assembly) for efficient gas fees and enhanced memory handling. 
Each function is streamlined for simplicity, preventing unnecessary complexity. For further details, 
reach out to me via LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/aloycwl/.

This DAO allows tokens and game management for the top 5 NFT holders.

The top 5 NFT holders are able to vote for or against new game joining, removal of game or withdrawal of huge
amount of tokens for airdrop, marketing purpose or any other reasons.

Only NFT holders are able to create vote and once they minted a NFT, they are automatically assigned
a sub node that will permanently stick to their address.

To prevent delibrate manipulation, the node is randomly assigned and the node numbers can be adjusted.
